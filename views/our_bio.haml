To make life more difficult for themselves they decided a brother was just what I needed. At the tended age of one I was joined by my brother Michael.</p><p>Our family moved to Canada about 15 years ago. We actually still live in that same house. Delta is so boring sometimes but it's not easy leaving the place you grew up in.</p><p>After leaving high school, like most eighteen year olds I was faced with the daunting question of figuring out my future. Probably not like most eighteen year olds, I decided to base my decision on coin toss. Literally a coin toss was how I decided which school to go to.</p><p>After graduating I've stayed at the same company for five years now.</p><p>A part of me loves stability. And a part of me thought life would go on as it always has forever. It probably would have if I never met Alice.</p>"})

Yes! I do cry a lot. I cry when I saw someone I don't know. I cry when I am hungry. I cry with no reason or maybe because I am shy.  (Not many believe I was shy when I was a kid)</p><p>I moved to Canada When I was grade 10. After I moved to Canada, I start my western life adventure. I studied in Douglas College for Hotel and Restaurant management and later I finish my Hospitality Management Bachelor Degree in Vancouver Community College. I worked in Swarovski, some restaurants and some hotels. I enjoy my work, I am lucky to have the chance to meet many great co-workers in my life.</p><p>I always work a lot and I love working. Working is my best friend. My friends always called me workaholic. After I started dating with Jimmy, we always had fun. Doesn't matter just a simple dinner, walking in Stanley park and I started to slowly learn how to enjoy my life. My best friend is not work anymore. Jimmy have taken over to become my best friend. I am lucky to have Jimmy as my other half and my new best friend.</p>"})
