      The first time that we went out was to Stanley park. We talked about our work, our school life, our interests. It was not a romantic topic when walking along the sea wall.

      After that, we had a whole series of adventures. Downtown shoe shopping, more badminton, some movies, visits to the aquarium. It was at the Capilano Suspension Bridge that we finally decided to become a couple. And that is where you are all invited to participate and witness our big day.

      On Oct 2013, we went to our first trip in Mexico. We had a great time there,. We did fish foot spa, which was an amazingly different experience in other cultures.  Later, we went back to Taiwan together during the Chinese New Year. Alice hasn't go back to Taiwan since she moved to Canada. It was fun and sweet we can both finally meet many family members that we haven't seen since moving to Canada.
